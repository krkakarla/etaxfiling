                <p>Rs. 40,000 is deductible if nothing is recovered from the insurance company or employer. From the
                    amount
                    deductible
                    (i.e., Rs.40,000 in this case), the amount received from insurance company as well as employer shall
                    be
                    deducted.
                    Therefore, Rs. 40,000 - Rs.3,000 - Rs.28,000 - Rs.6,000, i.e.,RS.3,000 is deductible.</p>
