                <p><b>SOLUTION</b></p>
                <li>Situation 1-As the annual insurance premium does not exceed 10% of sum assured and annual insurance
                    premium
                    is not more than Rs.2,50,000,section 10(10D) exemption will be available at the time of maturity of
                    ULIP.
                </li><br>
                <li>Situation 2-Annual insurance premium does not exceed RS.2,50,000 Consequently,fourth proviso or
                    fifth
                    proviso
                    to section 10(10D)as given above is not applicable.In other words exemption in this case cannot be
                    denied on
                    the
                    basis of fourth proviso or fifth proviso.In situation,section 45(1B)and section 112A are not
                    applicable.
                </li><br>
                <li>As annual insurance premium is more than 10% of sum assured,exemption is not available by virtue of
                    section 10(10D)(d).Capital gain will be chargeable to tax under section 45 and tax liability shall
                    be
                    calculated
                    within the parameters of section 112.
                </li><br>
                <li>Situation 3-Annual insurance premium does not exceed 10% of sum assured Exemption cannot be denied
                    because
                    of
                    operation of section 10(10D)(d).However,annual Insurance premium is more than
                    Rs.2,50,000.consequntely,by
                    virtue
                    of fourth and fifth proviso to section 10(10),X cannot claim Exemption.Capital gain will be taxable
                    under
                    section45(1B)
                    and tax will be computed within the parameters of section 112A.
                </li><br>
                <li>Situation 4-Annual insurance premium exceed 10% of sum assured Exemption is not available by virtue
                    of
                    section
                    10(10D)d.Moreover,annual premium is more than Rs.2,50,000.However,in the case,exemption is denied
                    not only
                    because
                    of fourth and fifth proviso.In such a case capital gain will be chargeable to tax under section 45
                    and tax
                    liability
                    shall be calculated within the parameters of section 112.
