                    a property from another resident seller,you have an obligation to deduct TDS if either the
                    consideration
                    or the stamp duty value of the property you purchase is exceeding Rs.50lakshs which is as per

                    short-term capital asset to
                    your seller.This is determined by the period of holding of the property by the seller,i.e if the
                    property is held by the seller
                    for more than 2years, then it is a long-term capital asset andif it's held for less than a period of
                    2years,it is short term capital asset

                    15CB is a certificate issued by a
                    chartered accountant These are mandatory if the payment is done directly to the foreign account of
                    the seller,but if you are transferring
                    the funds to the NRO account of the seller this is not mandated by the banker but the obligation to
                    file the form still lies with the buyer
                    of the property and there are penal implication on non-filing on the same.

                <ul><b>In Situation 1</b>, tax is deductible every month (at the time of Payment/credit of rent) at
                    the
                    rate of 10% under section 194-I</ul>
                <ul><b>In Situation 2 and 3 </b>194-I is not applicable. However, Y is required to deduct tax
                    at
                    source under sections 194-IB. Tax is deductible at the time of payment/credit of rent for the last
                    month
                    during the financial year 2022-23. Suppose, rent of March is paid on Marh 5, 2023. Tax is
                    deductible on
                    March 5, 2023 (TDS being Rs. 36,000)(i.e 5% of Rs 60,000 * 12 months from April 1, 2022 to March 31,
                    2023). If the recipient of rent does not have PAN, tax will be deductible at the rate of 20% by
                    virtue
                    of section 206AA. Total rent of the financial year is Rs. 7,20,000 (i.e Rs. 60,000 per month for 12
                    months). 20% of Rs 7,20,000 comes to Rs. 1,44,000. TDS of Rs. 1,44,000 cannot be deducted from rent
                    of
                    Rs 60,000 Payable on March 5, 2023. For such a situation, section 194-IB (4) given a relief (Tax
                    deductible by virtue of section 206AA cannot exceed the amount of rent payable for the last month
                    of
                    the financial year or last month of tenancy). To put it differently, Y should deduct tax f Rs.
                    60,000
                    out of rent of 60,000 payable to X (who does not have PAN) on March 5, 2023. Consequently amount of
