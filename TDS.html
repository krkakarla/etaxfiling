                    place that has
                    got good re-sale value,good ground water levels,neat ambiance,and proximate aminites.But apart from
                    the above,it is also
                    mandatory to know the legal aspects with respect to income tax act which you must know before
                    purchasing a property
                    in india.
                </p>
                <p>If you are resident of the country, i.e,you have stayed in india for a period of more than 182
                    days,and if you are purchasing
                    a property from another resident seller,you have an obiligation to deduct TDS if either the
                    consideration
                    or the stamp duty value of the property you purchase is exceeding Rs.50lakshs which is as per
                    section 194-1Aof
                    incometax Act.The applicable rate of TDS is 1% of the value of the consideration paid or the stamp
                    Duty value

                    electricity or water facility fee,maintenance fees,advance fees,or any other charges or similar
                    nature which are
                    incidental to the transfer of immovable property.this TDS must be deducated at the time of payment
                    made to the resident seller
                    and it has to be deposited to the government within 30 days from the end of the month of deduction.A
                    from 26QB also hands
                    to be deposited to the government within to fill in the details of the buyer,details of the property
                    tranferred.This is a mandatory
                    From before registering the proprty in your name. TDS certificate in form 16B shall be generated and
                    sent to the seller within 15days
                    of filling from26QB. </p>
                <p>Where if a resident is purchasing an immovable property from non-resident then the rules are slightly
                    different.
                    The TDS has to be deducated under section 195 in this case and you need to obaitan the TAN number
                    mandatorily.The rate of TDS
                    depends on whether the property is a long-term capital asset or ashort-term capital asset or a
                    short-term capital asset to
                    your seller.This is determined by the period of holding of the property by the seller,i.e if the
                    property is held by the seller
                    for more than 2years, then it is a long-term capital asset andif it's held for less than a period of
                    2years,it is short term capital asset
                    In case of long-term capital asset being purchased by you the rate of TDS is a given below: </p>

                    noted that if the NRI seller has applied to the assessing officer and obtained a certificate for
                    shorter deduction of TDS then
                    the TDS can be calculated on the capital gains amount else,this TDS has to be deducated on the value
                    of consideration or stamp duty
                    value whichever is higher.
                </p>
                <p>The TDS has to be deducated by the buyer at the time of payment and the same has to be paid on or
                    before the 7th of the next month except
                    for the month of march where the due date for payment is 30th April.From 27Qhas to be filed at the

                </p>
                <p>In addition to this Form 15CA and 15CB has to be complied with where from 15CA is a declaration made
                    by the person remitting the money
                    wherin he states that he has deducated the tax from any payment so made to the non-resident.From
                    15CB is a certificate issued by a
                    chartered accountant These are mandatory if the payment is done directly to the foreign account of
                    the seller,but if you are transferring
                    the funds to the NRO account of the seller this is not mandated by the banker but the obiligation to
                    file the form still lies with the buyer
                    of the property and there are penal implication on non-filing on the same.
